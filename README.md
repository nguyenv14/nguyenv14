### 👋 About Me  

👨‍💻 **I’m Vinh Nguyen**, a **software engineer** who finds joy in solving complex problems and building things that actually work.  

🏡 Outside of work, I’m a calm, home-loving person — often spending my time scrolling through my phone 📱, diving into stories 📖, or getting lost in the quiet comfort of my own thoughts.  

🎯 I value **simplicity**, **focus**, and **doing things with intention** — whether it’s writing clean code 💻 or just enjoying a good read ☕.
